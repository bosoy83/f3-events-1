# f3-events

Hello everyone by Airat :)

I was inspired by the Christian Knuth Event System library.

I thank him for that!

And I use the concept of the Christian Knuth library.

I hope that the Christian is not against! :)

Also, I had to remake some of the methods that I picked up from Fat Free Framework Base to integrate Dice DI

This event system need a debug and evolution

I'll add a few more methods later
