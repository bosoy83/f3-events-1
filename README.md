# f3-events

Hello everyone by Ayrat :)

I was inspired by the ikkez Event System library.

I thank him for that!

And I use the concept of the ikkez library.


Also, I had to remake some of the methods that I picked up from Fat Free Framework Base to integrate Dice DI

This event system need a debug and evolution

I'll add a few more methods later
